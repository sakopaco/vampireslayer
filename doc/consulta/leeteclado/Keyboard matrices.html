<h1>Keyboard matrices</h1>

<p>The key matrix is a matrix of 11x8 bits in which the currently 
pressed keys on the keyboard are indicated. This document contains an 
overview of all the available keymatrices, since they can be slightly to
 very different for different types of MSX computers. Also it discusses 
several oddities about using the keyboard matrix on MSX, and how to read
 it.</p>


<h2>The keyboard version value</h2>

<p>There is a keyboard version information value at bits 0-3 of address #002C in the BIOS, of which the values can be:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Keyboard version </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>Japanese</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>International (QWERTY/other)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>French (AZERTY)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>English</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>German (DIN)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>Spanish / Argentinian</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>However, this value isn’t really useful to determine which key matrix
 layout you have to use. Daniel Caetano reported having encountered 
several MSX computers where this was the case:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem resides in the fact the relation line/column -&gt; ASCII 
is NOT default. It seems to be different on several machines, even if 
they are from the same country and have similar keyboard. The result is:
 in some computers, the keys act as expected (when you press the “A” 
key, the A appears on the screen). But on other computers, when you 
press the “A” key, something different appears (say, an “8” is shown).</p>

<p>Before someone asks me, I know the byte 0x002C of ROM tells me the 
keyboard type. But this means nothing. On computers with the same value 
for this byte, the answer of the key matrix was different one from 
another. )^=</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyways, I think – and Daniel agreed with me on this – that at least 
rows 6-10 are pretty much equal on all MSX models (though many have no 
num pads), since they are used very often in games and people would 
notice immediately that certain games had their keyboard layout all 
mixed up. But the other rows are not. Anyways, take care, and if you’re 
not sure you can always just use the BIOS routines for it.</p>

<p>So what is the keyboard version byte useful for then?? It doesn’t 
indicate the matrix layout, but it does indicate the layout as it is 
presented to the user. So it might be somewhat useful if you need to 
determine where which keys are located on the keyboard. For example if 
you want to use the AWSD keys as a secondary set of ‘cursor keys’ for a 
2nd player, it would be interesting to know whether the player used a 
standard QWERTY keyboard or an AZERTY one (in which case the game should
 respond to the QZSD keys instead). But, in practice this isn’t all 
there is to the story either. As you can see on the picture of the 
Russian keyboard below, the key layout isn’t at all like QWERTY, but 
still that particular MSX’s BIOS indicates the layout as ‘1’ 
(international). Grmbl, they should have defined a 5th (Russian JCUKEN) 
layout! Or at least an ‘Other’ setting, instead of putting it under 
International.</p>

<h2 id="japlayout">Japanese layouts</h2>

<p>Similar to the  QWERY vs. AZERTY layouts on roman keyboards, Japanese
 computers also have two kinds of kana key mappings, where the 
characters are located at different places. One is called the 
JIS-layout, the other the ANSI-layout. In JIS, the Japanese kana 
characters are ordered like our QWERTY keyboards – all mixed up, 
presumably ordered to make the most freqently used characters easily 
accessible (or was it to prevent typing errors... well, never mind 
that). The ANSI layout in the contrary is ordered very logically, like a
 hypothetical roman ABCDEF keyboard.</p>

<p>I find it easiest to visually distinguish between the two by looking 
at the location of the very recognizable ‘no’ (の) character. On a JIS 
keyboard, it is among the letters, at the K. On an ANSI keyboard, it’s 
on the numbers row, at the 0. Note by the way that some keyboards show 
katakana characters instead of hiragana (such as the Sanyo Wavy 70FD), 
so there you need to look for a ‘no’ written as ノ. Must be very 
uncomfortable by the way, having two majorly different keyboard layouts.
 Ahwell.</p>

<p>It seems the most common computers use JIS, the turboR computers for 
example, but there are also quite a few which use ANSI. Fortunately, you
 do not have to guess about this. Bit 6 of PSG port A (register 14, 
read-only) indicates which of the layouts you should use. A 1 means the 
keyboard is JIS, a 0 means it is ANSI.</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>PSG Register</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>14</td>
    <td>bit 6: Keyboard layout (1=JIS, 0=ANSI) </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>


<h2 id="ghosting">Key Ghosting</h2>

<p>There is a limitation in most if not all MSX keyboards, which causes 
the effect known as ‘key ghosting’. This means that sometimes the matrix
 indicates a key you didn’t actually press as being pressed. If you for 
example try pressing SHIFT+S+X, there is a good chance that it will 
cause F1 to get ‘pressed’ aswell. Likewise, C+D+SPACE will also cause 
HOME to be pressed. The cause for this does not lay in a flaw in the MSX
 hardware, but rather in the keyboard itself. One could strongly reduce 
the happening of key ghosting by adding a series of diodes to the 
keyboard, however for some reason most, if not all, MSX manufacturers 
decided not to do so. Probably because it would require a fair number of
 added diodes :).</p>

<p>I’ll now try to explain why this effect occurs. Let’s start off with 
presenting you the following part of the (international) keyboard matrix
 layout, and please note that the highlighted keys are in the same two 
columns:</p>

<table class="matrix">
<tbody><tr>
  <th></th>
  <th>bit 7</th>
  <th>bit 6</th>
  <th>bit 5</th>
  <th>bit 4</th>
  <th>bit 3</th>
  <th>bit 2</th>
  <th>bit 1</th>
  <th>bit 0</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>row 5</th>
  <td>Z</td>
  <td>Y</td>
  <td style="background:#eee">X</td>
  <td>W</td>
  <td>V</td>
  <td>U</td>
  <td>T</td>
  <td style="background:#eee">S</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>row 6</th>
  <td>F3</td>
  <td>F2</td>
  <td style="background:#eee">F1</td>
  <td>CODE</td>
  <td>CAPS</td>
  <td>GRAPH</td>
  <td>CTRL</td>
  <td style="background:#eee">SHIFT</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>First off, some explanation about how a common MSX keyboard works. 
The keyboard has 11 row wires inside, and depending on the value in the 
row select register it will put power on one of the ten wires. To each 
of these ten wires, their 8 corresponding keys are connected. 
Furthermore, there are also 8 column wires in the keyboard, these 
connect all keys in the same column. Now, if for example row 6 is 
selected, and SHIFT is pressed, the switch below it will connect row 
wire 6 with column wire 0, and power will start to flow, which is 
detected and is put into the row read register as a 0.</p>

<p>So far, all is fine. However part of the problem starts to occur if 
you press the S key aswell (or any key connected to the same column 
wire). In that case, power flows from the row 6 wire through the SHIFT 
key into the column 0 wire, but then it will also flow from the column 0
 wire through the S key into the row 5 wire! So far no real problems 
yet, as setting row 6 will still result in a 11111110 value in the row 
read register (meaning SHIFT is pressed), and setting row 5 will do so 
likewise (meaning S is pressed).</p>

<p>Now imagine that you press the X key aswell. Remember that power is 
also flowing through row wire number 5, even though row 6 is selected, 
through the SHIFT and the S keys. If the X key is pressed, it connects 
the row 5 wire with the column 5 wire, resulting in both column wires 0 
and 5 having power on them, and the value 11011110 will be put into the 
row read register. With the row select register set to 6, this will show
 up as both SHIFT and F1 being pressed, even though F1 is actually not.</p>

<p>Had there been diodes on the column wires between X / F1 and S / 
SHIFT then this would not have happened, because then power cannot flow 
from the SHIFT key to the F1 key through the row 5 wire like that. So if
 you’d add diodes between all keys on the column wires (that’ll be 80 of
 them, to be precise :)), you would have partial protection against 
this. The most annoying cases of key ghosting (being typing MSX in 
capitals and typing CD&lt;space&gt;) would not occur anymore. However it
 is not complete protection, consider the SHIFT+F1+S scenario for 
example, it would still ghost the X key. This can be prevented by adding
 diodes between all keys on the row wires aswell (total diode count is 
now 157), however even then key ghosting can still occur (try 
SHIFT+F1+X). So complete protection against this can only be achieved by
 giving each key a separate wire, which means a much more complex board 
and controller.</p>

<p>The effect can also be countered in software. By not updating the key
 matrix in the system area when there are ghosted keys in it, the 
‘flawed’ key combination resulting in a key being ghosted will not be 
passed through to the underlying program. As key ghosting will only 
occur if 3 or more keys are being pressed, a fairly simple approach 
would be to skip the key matrix update if that is the case. However, it 
is not a very user-friendly approach. The current version of Meridian 
(at the time of writing) does this, and when typing text in capitals the
 delay between the actual key press and the key being detected is very 
annoying. A better approach would be to detect a ‘critical’ key 
combination, where a 1st key lies in the same row as a 2nd key, and at 
the same time that 2nd key is in the same column as a 3rd key. Only in 
that case key ghosting will occur, and then you can skip the matrix 
update. If the key matrix is read out into the system memory like that, 
the nasty effects will be gone, and the only effect it will show is that
 in some cases a key press is detected a little later than usual.</p>

<p>This still won’t allow the SHIFT+S+X combination to be pressed (for 
that you’d really need a hardware solution), however if you type the 
phrase ‘MSX’ a bit fast, and haven’t released the S key before you press
 the X key (which happens to me all the time), at least it will properly
 write down MSX and not add color 15,4,4’ because the F1 key is ghosted.</p>


<h2 id="reading">Reading the key matrix</h2>

<p>The key matrix can be read out through the PPI (part of the MSX engine):</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
  <th>Port range</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>#AA</td>
  <td>bits 0-3: Row select</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>#A9 (read)</td>
  <td>Row read (inverted)</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<pre>    in a,(#AA)
    and #F0         ; only change bits 0-3
    or b            ; take row number from B
    out (#AA),a
    in a,(#A9)      ; read row into A
</pre>


<p>However in general it is much easier to just read out the NEWKEY 
memory area at #FBE5-#FBEF which the BIOS interrupt routine (or your own
 interrupt routine) updates. Personally I like to refer to NEWKEY with 
“keys”. Please note that the keyboard matrix is inverted – a 0 means the
 key is pressed, while a 1 means it isn’t. Remember that a lot of 
keyboards haven’t got a numpad, so don’t use them for vital controls, or
 create an alternative (like Konami did in the headhunter game in SD 
Snatcher).</p>

<p>In the following example I will show you how to read out the space key its status. The space key is located in bit 0 of row 8:</p>

<pre>keys: EQU #FBE5

;
; Check whether space is pressed
;
Main_ReadKeys:
    ld a,(keys+8)   ; space
    bit 0,a
    jp z,spacepressed

    ...

    ret
</pre>

<p>The key readout itself is pretty trivial, however as you can see, I 
have put the key readout routines in a subroutine. It is good practice 
to do this because then the key handlers will in effect be called as 
subroutines so they can quite with a RET instead of having to manually 
JP back to the mainloop afterwards... <a href="http://www.acm.org/classics/oct95/">Go To Statement Considered Harmful</a>,
 eh ;). Actually the real objection against it in this case is that it 
introduces redundant code (being the “JP main” at the end of each 
keyhandler), which is bad; if you change something like for example the 
spot of the main routine which has to be jumped to, all those keyhandler
 exit jumps need to be changed and it is easy to forget one.</p>

<p>Finally, a small Basic program which you can use for keyboard matrix testing purposes:</p>

<pre>10 DEFINT A-Z:K=&amp;HFBE5:CLS
20 FOR I=0 TO 10:PRINT RIGHT$("0000000"+BIN$(PEEK(K+I)),8):NEXT
30 PRINT CHR$(11):GOTO 20
</pre>




<h2 id="layouts">The key matrix layouts</h2>

<p><em>(this list is still incomplete)</em></p>

<p>Two things: first of all, to display some key matrices you might need
 some fonts supporting Japanese characters and symbols, if you don’t 
have them already. Such as MS Gothic (in Japanese Language support) or 
Arial Unicode MS (comes with MS Office). The other thing is that if 
there are two characters in a cell, the first is the basic character, 
and the second is with SHIFT pressed.</p>

<p>Note: with GRAPH you can enter a couple of common Japanese 
characters; GRAPH-Y for ‘year’, GRAPH-S for ‘second’, and similarly 
‘hour’ and ‘minute’. The characters at GRAPH-1 to 7 are the days of the 
week, and GRAPH-8, 9 and 0 have the characters for 100, 1000 and 10000. 
GRAPH-&lt; has the character for ‘small’, &gt; has ‘big’ and GRAPH-L 
which is physically more or less inbetween &lt; and &gt; has the kanji 
for ‘middle’. And finally, GRAPH-¥ is the Yen kanji, and GRAPH-P is Pi
