Open cmd and type echo %QT_PLUGIN_PATH% if it's not empty then delete it (just google: delete environmental variable windows #, where # is your windows version)

Open cmd and type echo %PATH% and press enter. You'll see a list separated by ; of folder paths. Go line by line and make sure they do not point to a folder that contains a platforms folder that has qwindows.dll in it. If you find such a path edit the PATH variable and remove it (just google: edit environmental variable windows #, where # is your windows version)

What version of MiKTeX are you using?

@jrmmuller said in "could not find or load the Qt platform plugin "windows" in "",:

    If you could help me with the steps, that would be great!

    Download ListDLLs from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/listdlls
    Extract the contents of the zip file into C:\ListDLLs
    Try to launch MiKTeX. When the error dialog appears ("Could not find or load..."), leave it open; don't close the dialog.
    Press Windows+R (this launches the "Run" window)
    Type "cmd" into the "Run" window and press Enter (this launches the Command Line, cmd, that @VRonin mentioned)
    In cmd, type cd C:\ListDLLs and press Enter
    In cmd, type ListDLLs.exe miktex and press Enter. You should see a long list of DLLs.
    In cmd, type ListDLLs.exe miktex > output.txt and press Enter. You should see a new text file.
    Open C:\ListDLLs\output.txt and copy+paste its contents here.
    You can close the error dialog now.
    In cmd, type echo %QT_PLUGIN_PATH% and press Enter. What gets shown after that? Write it here. (this is related to @VRonin's suggestion)
